    "## How Elasticsearch represents data\n",
    "\n",
    "In Elasticsearch, a Document is the unit of search and index.\n",
    "\n",
    "An index consists of one or more Documents, and a Document consists of one or more Fields.\n",
    "In database terminology, a Document corresponds to a table row, and a Field corresponds to a table column.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The document is a collection of fields in a unique way, as defined in JSON format. It is used to store the data that resides inside the Elasticsearch index. So, it can be indexed. Every document belongs to a type and associated with a unique identifier (UID). It is expressed in JSON (Key: Value) pair. In RDBMS, a document is represented as a row in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparison to a relational database:\n",
    "In Elasticsearch terms, Document = Row, Field = Column, Index = Table, and Cluster = Database.\n",
    "\n",
    "ES is **schema free**"

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "it is **necessary to add mapping** declarations if you require anything but the most basic fields and operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is no different from specifying a schema!\n",
    "\n",
    "The schema declares:\n",
    "\n",
    "* what fields there are\n",
    "* which field should be used as the unique/primary key\n",
    "* which fields are required\n",
    "* how to index and search each field\n"

    "In ES, an index may store documents of different \"mapping types\". You can associate multiple mapping definitions for each mapping type. A mapping type is a way of **separating the documents** in an index into **logical groups**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Query DSL (Domain Specific Language) based is Elasticsearch's way of making Lucene's query syntax accessible to users, allowing complex queries to be composed using a JSON syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Lucene, there are basic queries such as term or prefix queries and also compound queries like the bool query."
