    "[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) an easily readable web format with a simple syntax. It typically enables the quick editing of text or documents displayed in a browser. Throughout the course, the exercises for the current programming topic will be in markdown cells of the [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) framework. If the exercise requires additional explanation of the results, then you'll have to note them down in markdown cells as well.\n",
